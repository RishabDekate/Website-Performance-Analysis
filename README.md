# Website-Performance-Analysis

## Project Background

As of 2025, the total number of websites on the internet is estimated to be around 110 to120 crore. Over 60% of web traffic now comes from mobile devices. This is a project analysis with python on a specific website traffic to help the company owning the website for increase the number of users on the website.

### Objective/ Business Problem:

The objective of this project is to analyze the traffic of the website of a company and give insights to the stakeholders so that, they can improve their channels on the website and increase users on the website.

### Key Questions:

- Which pattern or trends can you observe in website sessions and users over time?
- Which marketing channel brought the highest number of users to the website, and how can we use this insight to improve the traffic from other sources?
- Which channel has the highest average engagement time, and what does that tell us about user behaviuor and content effectiveness?
- How does engagement rate vary across different traffic channels?
- Which channels are driving more engaged sessions compared to non-engaged ones, and what strategies can improve engagement in underperforming channels?
- At what hours of the day does each channel drive the most traffic?
- Is there any correlation between high traffic(sessions) and high engagement rate over time?

## Interpretation & Insight Presentation

### Key Findings:
- As per analysis, the most users that comes on website does some type of session, but 16-20 is the peak time for user to come on website & performed sessions.
- The Organic Social channel drives the highest user traffic (up to 48,000 users), while the Unassigned, Organic Video, and Email channels show lower performance and should be prioritized for optimization by the marketing team to increase website user acquisition.
- Despite lower user acquisition, the Unassigned, Organic Video, and Email channels show higher average engagement time (Organic Video ~180 seconds). This suggests strong user interest, indicating that with increased marketing efforts, these channels have the potential to significantly boost user traffic.
- Boxplot analysis of engagement rate distribution reveals that the Referral channel has the highest engagement rate, while Email shows the lowest. Direct and Email channels exhibit low variation, suggesting unclear user intent, and the Unassigned channel shows zero engagement, indicating no user interaction.
- Engaged vs. non-engaged session comparison shows that Organic Social leads in both engaged and non-engaged sessions, indicating high traffic volume. However, the Direct channel has more non-engaged than engaged sessions, suggesting a need for improvement in user experience or targeting to boost engagement.
- We used heat map to analyse the traffic by hour and channel, so we get that we have most traffic in Organic Channel at 12 am.
- The correlation analysis between engagement rate and sessions over time indicates a subtle relationship. Notably, between April 5 and May 5, there was a high volume of sessions but relatively low engagement rate, suggesting that increased traffic did not translate into deeper user interaction.

### Future work:
The company needs to focus on some channels like Unassigned, Organic Video & Email for more user traffic.
